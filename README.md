# Arduino Codes
 Some basic Arduino commands performed over Arduino IDE


# Blinking-LED
Arduino program to perform blinking LED experiment-introduction to arduino

arduino pins can be configured ti act as input/output pins using the pinMode() function
pinMode(pin,mode)

pin-pin number of Arduino
Mode-Input/Output

digitalWrite():Writes a High or LOw value to a digital pin
analogRead():Reads from analog input pin :i.e voltage applied across the pin
Delay() funvtion used for time manipulation to provide a delay of specified time in milliseconds

# Requirements
Arduino Controller Board
USB COnnector
Bread Board
1.4 K resistor
connecting wires

Connect the positive terminal of LED to pin 12 and negative to GND
